# Storage carts

This mod gives you the ability to build storage carts from the game menu.  They cost 12 wood to build.

_Update:_
For game balance, they are now limited to a volume of 2000, so they aren't significantly better than storage barns.  I can't lower it anymore, else the starting resources on the hard game wouldn't fit into it.
